### Practical Advice for Your KL Adventure:

*   **Best Time to Visit:** Kuala Lumpur is pleasant year-round, but the dry seasons (May-July and December-February) offer less rainfall. Avoid major public holidays if you want to minimize local crowds.
*   **What to Bring:** Lightweight, breathable clothing (it\'s tropical!), comfortable walking shoes are a must, an umbrella or light rain jacket (for sudden downpours), a reusable water bottle, portable power bank for your phone, and cash for smaller vendors.
*   **Dress Code:** While KL is modern, it\'s also a multicultural city. Dress modestly, especially when visiting religious sites (shoulders and knees covered). Comfortable, casual wear is generally fine for daily exploration.
*   **Getting Around:** **Grab** (ride-hailing app) is your best friend in KL – it\'s affordable and efficient. The **LRT, MRT, and Monorail** are excellent for specific routes, especially to avoid traffic. Many central areas are also walkable.
*   **Approximate Daily Cost:** For a mid-range traveler enjoying local food, using Grab, and doing some souvenir shopping, budget around RM 150-250 per person per day (excluding accommodation and major high-end purchases). You can easily spend less if you stick to street food!
*   **Local Etiquette:** Always use your right hand when giving or receiving items, especially money or food. Ask permission before taking photos of people. Remove your shoes before entering homes and some shops/temples.

Enjoy your incredible journey through the vibrant heart of Kuala Lumpur!
